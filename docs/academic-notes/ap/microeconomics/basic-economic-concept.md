## Opportunity Cost

$OC = \dfrac{quantity\ of\ goods\ or\ services\ forgone}{quantity\ of\ goods\ or\ services\ gain}$

$OC_x = \dfrac1{OC_y}$

## PPF Shift

Rightward shifters of PPF

- Increment in **resource quantity / quality**
- Improvement in **productivity**
- Improvement in **technology**

## The Principle of Increasing Opportunity Cost

OC **increases** because resources aren't equally **adaptable**

## Advantage

- **Absolute Advantage**: can produce goods and services in **greater quantity** for **the same cost / less production cost**
- **Comparative Advantage**: produce goods and services at a **lower Opportunity Cost**

!!! note
    One producer can only have a Comparative Advantage on **only 1 kind of goods**

    **Comparative Advantage** decides **specialization**

## Principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility

Utility Maximizing Rule:

$\dfrac{MU_1}{Price_1} = \dfrac{MU_2}{Price_2}$
