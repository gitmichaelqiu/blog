## Practical Equipment

| Apparatus              | Resolution |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Meter rule             | 1mm        |

## Momentum

> The product of mass and velocity.

$p = mv$

### The Principle of Conservation of Momentum

> The total linear momentum before a collision is equal to the total linear momentum after a collision unless the system is acted on by a resultant external force

## Force

> The rate of change of momentum

$F = \dfrac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$

## Collisions

### Elastic Collisions

> The collision in which the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved

- The relative speed of approach = the relative speed of separation

### Inelastic Collisions

> The collision in which the total kinetic energy is not conserved

- Occurs when objects **crumple** and **deform**

## Center of Gravity

> The point at which the weight of the object may be considered to act

## Moment

> The turning effect of a force

$moment = Fd$

### Couple

> A pair of forces that acts to produce rotation only

- Equal in magnitude
- Opposite in direction
- Perpendicular to the distance between them

### Torque

> The moment of a couple

$\tau = Fd$

### The Principle of Moments

> For a system to be in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a point must be equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments (about the same point)

## Archimedes' Principle

> An object submerged in a fluid at rest has an upward buoyancy force (upthrust) equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object

$F = \rho g V$

## Energy

### The Principle of Conservation of Energy

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only transferred from one energy store to another

### Gravitational Energy

> Energy stored in a mass due to its position in a uniform gravitational field

### Kinetic Energy

> Energy an object has due to its motion

## Deformation

### Hooke's Law

> Extension is directly proportional to the applied force

$F = kx$

### The Spring Constant

> A measure of the stiffness of a spring

$k = \dfrac FX$

### Stress

> Applied force per unit cross sectional area

- The ultimate tensile stress is the maximum tensile stress before breaking

$\sigma = \dfrac FA$


### Strain

> Extension per unit length

$\epsilon = \dfrac XL$ 

### Young Modulus

> The ratio of stress and strain

- A measure of how **stiff** or **elastic** a material

$E = \dfrac \sigma \epsilon = \dfrac{FL}{Ax}$

## Wave

### The Wave Equation

$v = f \lambda$

### Wave Intensity

$I = \dfrac PA$

$I \propto A^2$

$I \propto f^2$

### Progressive Waves

> Waves that transfer energy without transfer of matter

#### Transverse Waves

> A wave in which the particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of motion and energy 

- Peaks and troughs
- Electromagnetic waves, visible light, UV, vibrations on strings
- Can be polarized

#### Longitudinal Waves

> A wave in which the particles oscillate parallel to the direction of motion and energy transfer 

- A rarefaction is an area of low pressure, with the particles being further apart from each other
- A compression is an area of high pressure, with the particles being closer to each other
- Cannot travel through a vacuum
- Sound waves

### Doppler Effect

$f_o = f_s (\dfrac{v}{v \pm v_S})$

- $v$: wave velocity
- $v_s$: velocity of the source relative to the observer

- Source moving towards: $v - v_s$
- Source moving away: $v + v_s$

- Source is moving
- Observer is stationary

| Gamma Rays  | 1e-16, 4e-13   |
| X Rays      | 4e-13, 1e-8    |
| Ultraviolet | 1e-8, 4e-7     |

### Malus's Law

> If unpolarized electromagnetic waves of intensity $I_0$ pass through a polarizer, the intensity of the transmitted polarized waves falls by a half

$I = \dfrac{I_0}2$

> If the analyzer is rotated by an angle θ  with respect to the polarizer, the intensity of the waves transmitted by the analyzer is given by the equation

$I = I_0 \cos^2(\theta)$

## Superposition

### The Principle of Superposition

> When two or more waves overlap at a point, the displacement at that point is equal to the sum of the displacements of the individual waves

### Wavelength of Stationary Waves

> Waves that do not transfer energy and matter

#### Fundamental Mode of Vibration / First Harmonic

The simplest wave pattern of a wave fixed at both ends is a single loop made up two nodes and an antinode.

- Nodes are locations of zero amplitude
- Antinodes are locations of maximum amplitude

#### Zero Open Ends

$L = \dfrac{n \lambda}2, n \in [1, 3]$

#### One Open End

$L = \dfrac{n \lambda}{4}, n\ is\ odd$

#### Two Open Ends

$L = \dfrac{n \lambda}2, n \in \mathbb{N}^*$

### Diffraction

> The spreading out of waves when they pass an obstruction

### Conditions for Constructive & Destructive Interference

- Constructive interference: path difference = $n \lambda, n \in \mathbb{N}$
- Destructive interference: path difference = $(n+\dfrac12) \lambda, n \in \mathbb{N}$

### Coherence

> Waves have the same frequency and constant phase difference

### Double Slit

$\lambda = \dfrac{ax}D$

- $\lambda$: wave length of source
- $a$: distance between the centers of the slit
- $x$: fringe width (distance between successive bright fringes)
- $D$: distance between the slits and the screen

### The Diffraction Grating

$d \sin(\theta) = n \lambda$

- $d$: spacing between adjacent silts
- $\theta$: angular separation between the order of maxima
- $n \in \mathbb{N}$: order or maxima
- $\lambda$: wavelength of source

To calculate the orders of maxima, $\theta = 90^\circ, \sin(\theta) = 1$

### Silt Spacing

Diffraction gratings come in different sizes measured by lines/m, represented by $N$

$d = \dfrac1N$
