**OptClicker** is a minimal macOS app that allows you to simulate a right-click or a right-click hold by pressing the Option key.

It will be quite helpful in **gaming with a touchpad**, as it allows you to perform left and right clicks simultaneously.

## 🖱️ Usage

### General

When OptClicker is enabled, press `option` to simulate a right-click, hold `option` to perform a right-click hold (e.g., for aiming).

The default global hotkey for toggling OptClicker is `control + R`.

You can modify it in Settings → Shortcuts. Press `esc` while changing the hotkey to disable it.

### Auto Toggle

After enabling Auto Toggle, you can choose target apps that when they are in front, OptClicker will automatically be turned on. You can add your games, for instance.

Shortcuts are available at the right of the + button, you can conveniently add Steam games, Chrome apps, CrossOver apps, Safari apps and Minecraft (it will add the process Java).

If the app is not packed as an `.app`, you can add process name. When the frontmost app has the same title as the process name designated, OptClicker will be turned on.

You can still turn OptClicker on when no target apps are frontmost. If you select `"Disable OptClicker"` in Auto Toggle, your manual setting is temporary and will be ineffective after switching apps; if you select `"Follow last setting"`, your manual setting is persistent for all not-target apps.

You are not able to modify *launch behavior* when Auto Toggle is on, for when app launches, it will check the frontmost app to determine whether turn OptClicker on.

## 📦 Installation

Requires **macOS 13.0 Ventura** or above.

1. Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/OptClicker/releases/)
2. Drag the app to the *Applications* folder
3. All set!

Because I do **NOT** have an Apple developer account for the app releases ~~(Apple charges an annual fee for this)~~, you may receive alerts such as "App is broken".

To resolve this, go to System Settings → the bottom of Privacy & Security → Open OptClicker.

In order to simulate right clicks, OptClicker will ask for Accessibility right. If you accidentally deny giving the right, go to System Settings → Privacy * Security → Accessibility → + at the bottom and select OptClicker.app.
